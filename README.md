# NN-Poetry-Generator
Developed a 5M parameter NN with LSTMs and Convolution Layers using TensorFlow that is able to predict succeeding words given an input sequence.
Trained the network on a dataset of poems of varying types. Then developed an algorithm that uses the NN to generate a poem given an input seed. 
On the first line of the notebook there will be a link that will allow you to open the notebook in Google Colab and run it yourself. A Pre-trained version 
of the model is included in this repo, allowing you to see the model's output without needing to train it yourself.
